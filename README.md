# ML_Project2-BitcoinPricePrediction

### Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can Machines See the Future of Crypto?
This project delves into the world of cryptocurrency, specifically focusing on Bitcoin price prediction. We leverage the power of machine learning to explore the fascinating question: can algorithms trained on historical data forecast future Bitcoin prices?

### Unveiling the Data:
We utilize a Bitcoin price dataset encompassing historical closing prices.

### Data Wrangling and Preparation:
Meticulously clean the data to ensure its accuracy and suitability for model training.
Craft informative features that empower the model to learn complex relationships within the data.

### Model in Action:
Employ a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
Train the model on a portion of the data and rigorously evaluate its performance on unseen data.

### Beyond the Predictions:
Explore the limitations and potential biases of the model.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning for potential performance improvements.
Integrate additional features like market sentiment or news analysis to enhance prediction accuracy.

### A Glimpse into the Code:
### The provided code snippets showcase core functionalities like:
Data loading and preprocessing
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
